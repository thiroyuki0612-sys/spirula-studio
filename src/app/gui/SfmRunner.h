// SfmRunner -- turns raw images or a video into a trainable dataset using this
// repository's own structure-from-motion, with nothing else installed.
//
// Same public shape as ColmapRunner (start / cancel / state / stage / error /
// dataset_dir / image_dir / drain_log) plus a progress fraction, so GuiApp
// drives either one through the same code.
//
// Pipeline:
//   DatasetPrep  (frames, sharpest-frame selection, .insv track split, masks)
//   spirula sfm auto  ->  <workspace>/sparse/0/{cameras,images,points3D}.bin
//
// The reconstruction runs in this process (app/gui/SfmInProcess.h). `subprocess`
// runs it as a child of this same executable instead -- the escape hatch for a
// driver that resets under a long solve. Either way the screen reads the same
// typed status, from the event stream or from the snapshot the child writes.
