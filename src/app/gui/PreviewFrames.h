// both need before a dataset run has extracted anything.

// The pixels come back processed -- turned, scaled, a 360 capture unwrapped --
// exactly as preparation will write them (app/FrameLook.h), read through the
// decoder preparation will use. What a panel shows is therefore the file the
// run produces, and a click drawn on it names a pixel the masker will read.
