// Batch processing: a list of rows, each of which can build a dataset, train
// it any number of times, and mesh what came out. None of those three has to
// exist yet when the queue is started.
//
// The list is data, not a runner. Driving it is GuiApp::advance_batch() --
// launch a task, wait for the runner that owns that stage, record, launch the
// next -- which reuses the live screens rather than being a second
// implementation of what those runners already are.
//
// Two properties an unattended queue must have: a failed task is an ordinary
// transition (the rest of its row is skipped, the next row still runs), and
// batch_check_row() reports the reasons a row will fail BEFORE anything starts.
