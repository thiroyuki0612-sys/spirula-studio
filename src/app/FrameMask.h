// FrameMask -- the part of every frame that is never scene.
//
// A fisheye border, a watermark, a timestamp and the rig holding the camera
// are all fixed in image space for a whole capture, so they are geometry
// rather than segmentation: no model, no per-frame inference, one stencil per
// camera intersected with whatever else masking produced.
//
// Shapes are normalized to the image (x, rx by width; y, ry by height) so one
// stencil serves every resolution the same frames are stored at.
