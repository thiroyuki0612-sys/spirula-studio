// Prompt-to-mask policy, shared by the CLI, the GUI's preview and its run:
// positive phrases unioned; negative ones carved back out (a region matching
// one is KEPT); the mask says what to keep, so prompted objects come out black
// unless `keep_prompted`; a longest-side cap on what the model sees. Also the
// visual path (clicks, SeedPrompt), the two non-SAM models, BiRefNet's
// subject and Grounding DINO's boxes (MaskOptions), and the second mask that
// keeps the sky out of feature extraction only. src/sam/README.md.

// are SEPARATE: a model prompted with a click on the dog and a click on the
// bicycle returns one mask that fits neither, so each object gets its own id
// and its own tracked instance, and the masks are unioned afterwards. And a
// click belongs to the FRAME it was drawn on: pointing at (900, 500) says
// nothing about frame 400 of a moving capture, which is why this carries a
// frame rather than being applied to all of them.
//
// Several seeds sharing an `object` refine one instance as the capture goes
// on: the first is what starts the track, the rest are corrections at the
