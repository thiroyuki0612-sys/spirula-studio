// The camera-group settings used to travel as `--camera-model PREFIX=MODEL`
// and `--focal DIR=PX`, re-resolved against the filesystem in the child; a
// manifest states them once, in a file a person can read and edit. It is also
// where per-image priors go when there is something producing them -- GPS,
// IMU gravity, range data -- so a new sensor is a new key, not a new flag.
//
// Read as YAML or JSON (data/Yaml.h takes both); written as either.
