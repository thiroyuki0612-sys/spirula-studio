// The extractor seam: what `extract` calls, and the factory that decides which
// one it gets.
//
// GPU SIFT (sfm/feature/Sift.h) was the only implementation and the extract
// stage constructed it directly. That is no longer true -- ALIKED
// (src/aliked/) implements the same contract -- and the indirection buys two
// things beyond the obvious:
//
//   * the SIFT extractor's Vulkan context is not created when it is not the
//     one selected, which matters because ALIKED carries the inference layer's
//     own device and two live devices on one GPU is something this repository
//     sequences deliberately (AGENTS.md);
//   * each extractor states what it needs from the loader (color, working
//     resolution) rather than the CLI knowing per-type rules.
//
// Nothing above this seam assumes 128-D uint8, a scale or an orientation.
