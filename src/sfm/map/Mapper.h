// Incremental Structure-from-Motion mapper (src/sfm/README.md).
//
// MVP control flow, ported in spirit from COLMAP's IncrementalMapper:
//   seed pair -> initialize (relative pose + triangulate)
//   loop: register-next (2D-3D via the correspondence graph, PnP RANSAC)
//         -> continue tracks + triangulate new points
//         -> periodic global BA + reprojection filtering
//
// Robustness (D36) follows COLMAP: strict seed acceptance with stepwise
// relaxation, PnP inlier-count and inlier-ratio gates with nonlinear pose
// refinement, iterated global BA + filtering (reprojection and triangulation
// angle) at 10% model growth, and de-registration of images the filtering
// hollows out -- the mapper's way of undoing a registration that stopped
// agreeing with the model.
//
// Remaining simplifications (src/sfm/README.md / D10): transitive tracks
// approximated by one-hop correspondences, global BA only (no local BA), no
// retriangulation/merge pass. Points are colored by averaging the
// per-keypoint colors sampled at extraction; each has a clear upgrade path.
