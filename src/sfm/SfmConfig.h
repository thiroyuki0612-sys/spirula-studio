// The one option surface of the SfM pipeline: an aggregate of the stage option
// structs, plus a descriptor table that every consumer reads instead of writing
// its own list.
//
// Why a table. The pipeline has ~90 knobs spread over eight option structs, and
// three consumers need the same view of them: the CLI parser, `--help`, and
// (port plan phase 5) the GUI's options editor. Written by hand that is three
// lists that drift; here the table is the source of truth and each consumer is
// one macro expansion over it -- the same shape as the trainer's generated
// SS_CONFIG_FIELDS / ConfigUI pair.
//
// What is NOT in the table: flags that do not name one scalar field.
// `--camera-model PREFIX=MODEL` and `--focal PREFIX=F` also feed a per-group
// override list, `--no-manage` moves four fields at once, `--check` / `--audit`
// pick what the command does rather than how, and `-o/--output` is positional
// in spirit. Those stay hand-parsed in the CLI, which tries them *before* the
// table, so a hand-parsed name always wins.
//
// Layering: the sub-option structs are untouched, and the pipeline-level knobs
// here are the ones that span stages (`--max-error` is one tolerance measured
// in one frame, D47, but two struct fields; `--device`, `--quiet` and the
// camera settings likewise). finalize() is what fans them out; nothing else
// may, or the CLI and the GUI would have to agree on the fan-out separately.
