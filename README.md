Spirula Studio trains 3D Gaussian Splatting models &ndash; from raw photo/video to splat to textured mesh &ndash; in one self-contained binary. No Python/PyTorch, no separate COLMAP install. Runs on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple GPUs via Vulkan, trains 10M full-SH Gaussians in 8 GB VRAM, and has native support for fisheye and 360° cameras.

## Windows PCでの起動（初心者向け）

1. [Windows版のダウンロードページ](https://github.com/harry7557558/spirula-studio/releases/latest)を開き、`windows-vulkan-x86_64.zip` をダウンロードして展開します。
2. 展開したフォルダー内の `spirula.exe` をダブルクリックします。インストールや開発ツールは不要です。

リポジトリをダウンロードした場合は、フォルダー内の `PCで起動.bat` をダブルクリックすると同じ公式版を起動できます。Windows 10/11 の 64 ビット版と Vulkan 対応 GPU が必要です。詳しくは[Windows向け起動ガイド](docs/windows-quick-start-ja.md)を参照してください。

撮影から、データセット作成、学習、保存と再開、編集・書き出しまでは、[日本語操作マニュアル](docs/manual-ja.md)にまとめています。初めての方は第1部「はじめて編」、設定の意味を知りたい方は第2部「詳しく知る編」を読んでください。

- **September 10, 2026: Metric scale** &ndash; The dataset creation module now uses telemetry metadata in common video and image formats to recover metric scale and orientation, addressing the popular report that reconstruction results are too large/small or tilted.

- **September 3, 2026: LoMa feature support** &ndash; The SfM module now supports [LoMa](https://github.com/davnords/LoMa) for feature detection and matching on difficult datasets.

- **August 14, 2026: macOS support** &ndash; Support for training on macOS/Apple Silicon has been validated. The app can now be downloaded from [Releases page](https://github.com/harry7557558/spirula-studio/releases/).

- **August 8, 2026: Multilingual support** &ndash; Multilingual support has been added, available to both GUI and CLI. Supported languages: English, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 한국어, Deutsch, Français, Español, Português, Italiano, Nederlands, Русский, Türkçe.


## Download

Binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS can be downloaded from [Releases page](https://github.com/harry7557558/spirula-studio/releases/). Simply select the one for your platform, download and unzip, and double click to open the GUI.

If you are training on remote/cloud GPUs, you may use the CLI &ndash; Run `spirula --help` for details. By default, `spirula train` command will serve a viewer on an HTTP port, one you can forward over ssh and view training progress in your web browser.

A reconstruction too large for one training run can be split into parts that train one at a time and merge back into one model: the **Partition** button on the dataset screen, or `spirula partition split <dataset>` / `spirula partition merge <partition.json>` on the command line (see `docs/notes/scene-partition.md`).


## Build from source

To build from source, Spirula Studio provides two backends:

- **Vulkan (Recommended):** The cross-platform and cross-vendor option. Most tested. Works on all major GPUs. Faster to build and produces smaller binary.

- **CUDA:** Legacy option for CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPUs.

Both provide the same training and meshing functionality. CUDA backend may be faster or slower than Vulkan depending on GPU driver, with difference generally within a few percents. Vulkan backend can be slightly more VRAM efficient in some cases.

| Backend | GPU/Vendor Support | Platform Support | Dependencies | Additional Features |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Vulkan | NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon | Windows, Linux, macOS | Vulkan/MoltenVK, CMake/Ninja | Native support for SfM, frame extraction from videos, and AI masking |
| CUDA | Most NVIDIA GPUs | Windows, Linux | CUDA, CMake/Ninja | - |

<summary>Details for building the Vulkan backend</summary>

<br/>

Make sure you have Vulkan SDK installed. On macOS, MoltenVK is automatically fetched by CMake. Clone the repository and run the commands:

### Windows with MSVC:

```bat
cd spirula-studio\
.\build_develop.bat -DSS_BACKEND=vulkan -DSS_ENABLE_PATENTED=ON
```

If it builds successfully, you get `build_vulkan\spirula.exe`.

### Windows with GCC/Clang:

```bat
cd spirula-studio\
cmake -G Ninja -B build_vulkan -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSS_BACKEND=vulkan -DSS_ENABLE_PATENTED=ON -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=Ninja
cmake --build build_vulkan -j
```

Pass `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` to the first `cmake` command if needed.

If it builds successfully, you get `build_vulkan\spirula.exe`.

### Linux:

```bash
cd spirula-studio/
bash build_develop.bash -DSS_BACKEND=vulkan -DSS_ENABLE_PATENTED=ON
```

If it builds successfully, you get `build_vulkan/spirula` binary.

### macOS:

```bash
cd spirula-studio/
bash build_develop.bash -DSS_BACKEND=vulkan -DSS_ENABLE_PATENTED=ON
cmake --build build --target macos_app
cmake --build build --target macos_dmg
```

macOS has only the one backend, so it builds into `build/` rather than into a per-backend tree. If it builds successfully, you get `build/spirula` binary similar to Linux. Additionally, it wraps that binary in a double-clickable `build/Spirula Studio.app`, as well as disk image `build/Spirula Studio.dmg`. MoltenVK is statically linked by default and will run on a Mac without dependency installed.

### Notes regarding third-party licensing

`-DSS_ENABLE_PATENTED=ON` enables decoding video on the GPU instead of shelling out to ffmpeg (about 15x faster frame extraction, and without need to install ffmpeg). However, AVC/HEVC bitstream parsers carry third-party patent exposure. If you turn this on, you are responsible for ensuring compliance with local patent laws regarding AVC/HEVC playback.

Masking needs a SAM checkpoint, which the GUI downloads on first use and caches. The checkpoints are Meta's models under Meta's licenses &ndash; SAM 2.1 is Apache-2.0, SAM 3 is under Meta's own, non-standard license. They are never bundled, and the GUI shows the terms before fetching anything. On the command line, point `--model` at a file you downloaded yourself.

<summary>Details for building the CUDA backend</summary>

<br/>

Make sure you have a recent version of CUDA installed. On Windows, you also need MSVC compiler compatible with your CUDA version. Clone the repository and run the commands:

### Windows:

```bat
cd spirula-studio\
.\build_develop.bat -DSS_BACKEND=cuda
```

If it builds successfully, you get `build_cuda\spirula.exe`.

### Linux:

```bash
cd spirula-studio/
bash build_develop.bash -DSS_BACKEND=cuda
```

If it builds successfully, you get `build_cuda/spirula` binary.

## Trivia

Spirula Studio (formerly spirulae-splat) is named after the now-inactive project [spirulae](https://github.com/harry7557558/spirulae), which was named after the [deep-ocean cephalopod mollusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirula).

Spirula Studio is developed and maintained almost entirely by one person. Issues and PRs welcome &ndash; I sometimes respond late, but rest assured that I do review them all.
