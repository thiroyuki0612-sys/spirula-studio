# Reading OpenEXR

`src/core/ExrImage.{h,cpp}` is this repository's OpenEXR reader. It is ~1900
lines with no dependency beyond the vendored miniz, and it exists instead of
`FetchContent(openexr)` for two reasons: OpenEXR drags in Imath and a large
build, and it is slower — on the two 6000×4000 half-float captures this was
written against, decode-to-`float32` measures

| file | this reader (32 cores) | OpenEXR 3.4 (python binding) |
|---|---|---|
| 24 MPix, PIZ | 174 ms | 370 ms |
| 24 MPix, ZIP | 130 ms | 174 ms |

(best of three, warm page cache) — and OpenEXR hands back `float16` while these
numbers include the widening to `float32`. Single-threaded the same files take
858 ms and 468 ms; chunks are independent, so the pool is over chunks and one
image scales across cores.

## What it reads

- **Storage** — scanline and tiled parts. Mipmapped and ripmapped tiles decode
  at level 0; the other levels are skipped.
- **Compression** — `NONE`, `RLE`, `ZIPS`, `ZIP`, `PIZ`, `PXR24`, `B44`,
  `B44A`, `DWAA`, `DWAB`.
- **Pixel types** — `HALF`, `FLOAT`, `UINT`, mixed freely within one file.
- **Channels** — `R`/`G`/`B`(`/A`); a single named layer (`diffuse.R`, …) when
  there are no bare ones; `Y` alone as greyscale; `Y`/`RY`/`BY` with subsampled
  chroma; and a one-channel file of any name as greyscale.
- **Windows** — the decoded image is the **display** window. A data window
  smaller than it leaves the surrounding pixels at zero, which is what keeps a
  cropped render aligned with the intrinsics that describe the full frame.
- **Multi-part** — the first part with colour channels wins, so a beauty pass
  beside a depth or ID part reads correctly. A part list with no colour part
  falls back to the first single-channel part.
- **Broken offset tables** — an all-zero chunk table (an interrupted write) is
  reconstructed by walking the chunks. Individual zero entries are skipped.

Correctness is checked against OpenEXR itself: 77 generated cases across that
matrix decode **bit-exactly**, single- and multi-threaded, as do the two
6000x4000 production captures and eight frames spread across a 3840x2160
`DWAA` shot.

## What it refuses, and what to do about it

Each of these fails with a sentence naming the problem rather than producing
wrong pixels.

| Not supported | Message says | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| deep (`deepscanline`, `deeptile`) | it is deep | flatten it |
| several layers, no bare `R`/`G`/`B` | the layer names it found | write one layer to its own file |
| `B44` channels flagged `pLinear` | that flag | re-save as ZIP |
| big-endian hosts | a `#error` at compile time | — |

Two more limits are silent because they do not affect what we do with the
pixels: `pixelAspectRatio` is ignored, and subsampled `RY`/`BY` chroma is
upsampled nearest rather than through OpenEXR's 27-tap filter.

## DWA, and whose bits

`DWAA` and `DWAB` are a lossy DCT codec, so "bit-exact" needs a referee:
OpenEXR picks its inverse DCT at run time, and its three versions round
differently. The scalar one takes its constants from `cosf`, the SSE2 one
from literals that differ by a few float ulps, and the AVX one (inline
assembly that MSVC cannot build) adds in yet another order. Which one a build
of OpenEXR runs:

| OpenEXR built for | inverse DCT |
|---|---|
| x86-64, MSVC (e.g. the Windows python wheel) | SSE2 |
| x86-64, GCC/Clang, CPU without AVX | SSE2 |
| x86-64, GCC/Clang, CPU with AVX | AVX |
| ARM, or built with its run-time CPU check off | scalar |

This reader reproduces the SSE2 one, operation for operation, with float
contraction switched off around it so no compiler fuses a multiply-add. Against
an OpenEXR on one of the other rows, some pixels differ, by a half-float step
or so before the linear table: far below the codec's own loss.

The rest of the codec is deterministic: the Huffman, zlib and RLE stages, the
channel classifier (the version 2 rule list in the block, or the built-in rules
for older files), the Y'CbCr triple for `R`/`G`/`B` sharing a prefix, and the
2.2-gamma/log table that turns the stored values back to linear, built with
`powf` exactly as OpenEXR builds it. A channel flagged `pLinear` skips that
table.

## Colour space

EXR pixels are scene-linear by specification, and `Info::is_linear` is
therefore always true. `Info::gamut` comes from the file's `chromaticities`
attribute, matched against the six gamuts in `core/ColorSpace.h` within 0.002
on all eight numbers — **including the white point**, so P3-D65 does not
silently become the theatrical-white `DCI-P3` (that would be a visible green
shift). An unmatched set leaves `gamut_known` false and falls back to Rec.709,
which is also what a file with no `chromaticities` gets, per the spec.

`decode_srgb8()` takes the caller's declaration and falls back to the file's
own only when the caller made none, since an EXR holding sRGB code values is a
mistake rather than a convention. That fallback is what makes an EXR readable
by the SfM front end and the AI models with no flags at all.

**A file can lie.** One of the two captures this was built against is an EXR of
display-encoded pixels — γ≈2.2, nothing above 1.0 — despite the format's
promise. Nothing in the header says so, so the override has to be reachable:
the trainer's `--image-color-is-linear` is a tri-state (`auto` / `true` /
`false`, the same shape as `--splat-color-is-linear`) and `--image-color-gamut`
lists **both** `none` (take it from the file) and `Rec.709` (sRGB primaries,
whatever the file says). Which curve those linear values then leave through is
a separate flag again -- `docs/notes/color-transfer.md`. The two halves are adopted independently, so declaring
the transfer still leaves the primaries to the file and vice versa. The same split runs all the way down: `spirula sfm`, `spirula geometry` and
`spirula sam` all take `--no-image-linear` beside `--image-linear`, the dataset
screen offers **From the file / Linear light / Display-encoded** next to the
gamut's own **From the file**, and its runners state on the child's command
line only the half the user answered. The give-away for such a file is a
maximum of exactly 1.0 across a whole scene-linear capture, and `spirula sfm`
warns when it sees one: every image it decoded as linear peaked at exactly 1.0.

A TIFF with an ICC profile declares its colour space the same way and goes
through the same adoption (`imagefile::declared_color_space`,
`docs/notes/tiff.md`).

## Where it is wired in

Callers that also read stb_image's formats reach it through
`core/ImageFile.h`, which dispatches TIFF (`docs/notes/tiff.md`) the same way.

- `spirula sfm` — `sfm::loadGrayImage`, decoding to sRGB on the decode pool
  with `threads = 1` (the pool above already owns every core). An exposure
  for what the detectors see applies here and in the two below
  (`docs/notes/analysis-exposure.md`).
- `spirula sam` / `spirula geometry` — `nn::load_image`, same conversion.
- Training — `DataManager`'s RGB decode. An EXR probes as `FLOAT32`, never
  `UINT16`: half-float carries values above 1 and 16-bit normalized would clip
  every one of them. That costs 12 B/px in the batch buffer, so
  `--cache-images disk` (the default) is the mode to stay in for large frames.
- GUI — frame selection, the stencil detector, the dataset previews, and
  `ImageCompare`'s "Original file" pane, which quantizes the file's own values
  with no transfer curve so it shows what is stored rather than a display of it.

Masking (`SS_BUILD_SAM`) reads them too. The hand-run
`reference/scripts/mask.py` cannot -- Pillow has no EXR reader -- so it counts
the files it could not open and says so at the end of the run rather than
leaving the capture silently unmasked.

## Testing

`src/core/tests/exr_decode.cpp` builds as `exr_decode` and checks the reader
against a set of EXRs generated by `tools/gen_exr_cases.py` (which needs the
`OpenEXR` python package; the cases are not committed). Run:

```bash
python tools/gen_exr_cases.py /tmp/exr_cases
./build_vulkan/exr_decode /tmp/exr_cases
```
