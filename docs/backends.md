# Backends

Two interchangeable compute backends behind one seam. **Both must work.**

The authoritative documents live next to the code and are more detailed than
this page — this is the orientation, they are the reference:

- **`src/backend/README.md`** — the seam's design:
  what `api/` is, why the per-kernel `.cuh` headers are authoritative and the
  module headers are forwarders, and how `BackendRuntime.h` abstracts
  alloc/memcpy/memset/events.
- **`src/backend/vulkan/README.md`** — the Vulkan
  backend in depth: verified premises, device baseline and per-capability
  pipeline variants, memory model, atomics strategy, sort/scan, Slang compiler
  notes, and **the kernel coverage table**. Read it before touching anything
  under `backend/vulkan/`.

## The seam

```
Engine*.cpp  ──►  backend/api/*.h              (launch declarations)
                  backend/api/BackendRuntime.h (alloc / memcpy / memset / events)
                        │
        ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
  CUDA: src/kernels/**/*.cu       Vulkan: src/backend/vulkan/
        + src/instantiations/           runtime + kernels/ + shaders/
        │                                │
        └────► backend/common/SortScan.h ◄────┘
               CUB (CUDA) / onesweep radix + prefix sum (Vulkan)
```

The engine layer is already torch-free *and* CUDA-free: it calls kernels only
through launch functions exported via `/*[AutoHeaderGeneratorExport]*/`
markers. The `api/` directory makes that implicit boundary explicit.

`backend/api/BackendTypes.h` provides portable CUDA-layout vector types and
empty `__device__`/`__host__` macros, so the whole declaration surface parses
under `-DSS_BACKEND_VULKAN` with no CUDA toolkit installed.

## Shared device math

`src/shaders/*.slang` is compiled **twice**: to CUDA headers (`src/generated/*.cuh`)
and to SPIR-V. The projection, SH, primitive and PPISP math therefore has one
source. `src/backend/vulkan/shaders/*.slang` adds the Vulkan-only compute entry
points and the compatibility layers (`int64_compat`, `int8_compat`, `atomic_float`).

Don't fork device math per backend. If a backend needs different code, it
belongs in a capability variant (below), not a copy.

## Vulkan capability variants

Rather than requiring optional features, each entry point is compiled into
several SPIR-V blobs and the pipeline layer picks per device at module load —
no in-shader branching:

| suffix | feature | fallback when absent |
|---|---|---|
| `.atomicadd` | `VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float` | CAS-loop emulation (Intel ANV) |
| `.noint64` | `shaderInt64` | `uint2` word-pair emulation for keys, morton codes, indexing |
| `.int8` | `shaderInt8` + `storageBuffer8BitAccess` | packed u32 word access |

Baseline is Vulkan 1.2 core with `bufferDeviceAddress` + `timelineSemaphore`.
Subgroup size is **never** assumed to be 32 — AMD wave64 and Intel
variable-width are first-class. `SS_VK_NATIVE_ATOMICS=0`,
`SS_VK_NATIVE_INT64=0`, `SS_VK_NATIVE_INT8=0` force the fallback blobs
for A/B testing, and `SS_VK_CAS_UNIFORM_EXIT=0/1` the wave-uniform CAS
loop that AMD's Windows driver gets by default (src/backend/vulkan/README.md).

The Vulkan README documents hard-won specifics that are easy to regress —
e.g. the emulated i64 scan accumulator must stay a `uint2` rather than a
two-field struct, because one Intel Windows driver segfaults in
`vkCreateComputePipelines` on the struct form.

## Adding or changing a kernel

Three deliverables, always:

1. **CUDA**: `src/kernels/<family>/<Kernel>.cu` (+ `_kernel.cuh` if the device body is shared
   between fwd/bwd or eval3d/non-eval3d), with
   `/*[AutoHeaderGeneratorExport]*/` on the launcher. Rerun
   `generate_headers.py`, and `generate_kernel_instantiation.py` if it is
   templated over primitive / camera model / SH degree.
2. **Vulkan**: the Slang entry point in `backend/vulkan/shaders/*.slang` and its
   launcher in `backend/vulkan/kernels/*.cpp`.
3. **Parity test**: a tool in `backend/tests/` that builds under both backends
   and does `dump` / `compare`. See [testing.md](testing.md).

If step 2 isn't done yet, `generate_vulkan_stubs.py` emits a **throwing** stub
so the portable engine still links. That is a TODO marker, not a completed
port — and rerunning the generator after a port lands is required, or the
symbol ends up defined twice.

If a new subsystem appears, add its module header to `generate_backend_api.py`
and add the kernel family to `generate_headers.py`'s `header_names` list.

## Performance notes

Backend performance is not uniform, and the differences are large enough to
change design decisions:

- Write-coalescing, not atomic throughput, has repeatedly been the dominant
  cost in the fused projection-backward/optimizer path on Vulkan. Staged
  coalesced writeback plus a tree reduction fixed it.
- Vulkan driver choice matters (`amdvlk` vs RADV differ by an order of
  magnitude on some kernels). When comparing, state the driver.

Four things cost a Slang port time that the CUDA source gets for free, and
all four have turned up more than once (measured on an RTX 5070 Laptop,
driver 580, against the CUDA build of the same kernel):

- **`groupshared` is allocated per pipeline, not per branch.** CUDA sizes a
  `__shared__` array with `constexpr ? N : 1` and the unused feature costs
  nothing; the Slang equivalent allocates it anyway. Size those arrays with
  the specialization constant that gates them — SPIR-V takes a spec-constant
  array length. `rasterize_bwd_2d` went 8.6 KB -> 4.2 KB that way, which is
  11 -> 24 workgroups per SM and 19% off the kernel.
- **A params struct in the ring costs ~17 registers.** CUDA kernel arguments
  live in constant memory and are free; a ring struct is read through a
  device address, and the driver's loads are `strong`, so they cannot sink to
  their uses and the whole struct stays live from entry. Push the struct
  directly whenever it fits under the 128-byte floor (`rasterize_fwd_2d`:
  55 -> 45 registers, 7% off).
- **Check groupshared bank conflicts on any `[a][b]` scratch** whose *minor*
  axis is uniform across the lanes and whose major axis varies. The radix
  downsweep's `[digit][subgroup]` ranking scratch put 32 lanes on 2 banks;
  transposing it to `[subgroup][digit]` was 12% of the whole binning stage.
- **A groupshared tree reduction costs a barrier per level.** Use
  `WaveActiveSum` and one barrier, which is what `cg::reduce` compiles to on
  the CUDA side. `ppl_fwd` reduces once per raw loss and was paying ~200
  workgroup barriers a launch; the wave version is 42% faster and now beats
  CUDA.

Two differences that are NOT worth chasing, so nobody re-derives them:

- Loads through a buffer device address always compile to `ldg.e.strong.sm`
  on NVIDIA, never to the read-only `ldg.e.constant` that `const __restrict__`
  gets in CUDA. `RestrictPointer` on the pointer and the Vulkan memory model
  both leave it unchanged; only a descriptor-bound read-only buffer gets
  `.constant`, which is not a trade this backend is making.
- The remaining rasterize-backward gap is codegen, not structure: with the
  same occupancy, the same shared-memory layout and the same instruction
  mix, the driver emits ~17% more instructions for the sweep loop (extra
  MOV / LOP3 / VOTE around the inlined early-outs).

Use `SS_PROFILE=1` for the per-stage and per-kernel breakdown before
optimizing anything, and the benchmark tools (`raster_bench`, `fpbo_bench`)
rather than a training run for anything whose cost depends on the scene —
see [testing.md](testing.md#profiling).
